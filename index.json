For example, considerable work has shown that egocentric perspectives can arise more quickly, with other perspectives (such as of task partners) emerging only secondarily. This theoretical dichotomy is challenged here, and we propose a general view of perspective-taking as an emergent phenomenon governed by the interplay among several cognitive mechanisms. We first describe the pervasive relevance of perspective-taking to cognitive science. A dynamical systems model is then introduced which explicitly formulates the timescale interaction proposed. Implications are discussed, with ideas for future empirical research.","tags":null,"title":"Interacting Timescales in Perspective-Taking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pablo Contreras Kallens","Rick Dale","Morten H.

In humans, categories are shared and communicated between minds, thus requiring explanations at the population level. In this paper, we discuss the current state of research on the cultural evolution of categorization. We begin by delineating key properties of categories in need of evolutionary explanation. We then review computational modeling and laboratory studies of category evolution, including their major insights and limitations. Finally, we discuss remaining challenges for understanding the cultural evolution of categorization.","tags":null,"title":"Cultural Evolution of Categorization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pablo Contreras Kallens","Rick Dale"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530489600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530489600,"objectID":"b0eb8482c2278c19dbf372e269d3a6fa","permalink":"https://www.contreraskallens.com/publication/exploratory-mapping/","publishdate":"2018-07-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/exploratory-mapping/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a case study of how scientometric tools can reveal the structure of scientific theory in a discipline. Specifically, we analyze the patterns of word use in the discipline of cognitive science using latent semantic analysis, a well-known semantic model, in the abstracts of over a thousand academic papers relevant to these theories. Our results show that it is possible to link these theories with specific statistical distributions of words in the abstracts of papers that espouse these theories. We show that theories have different patterns of word use, and that the similarity relationships with each other are intuitive and informative. Moreover, we show that it is possible to predict fairly accurately the theory of a paper by constructing a model of the theories based on their distribution of word use. These results may open new avenues for the application of scientometric tools on theoretical divides.","tags":null,"title":"Exploratory mapping of theoretical landscapes through word use in abstracts","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\u0026hellip;\n","date":1530158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530158400,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"https://www.contreraskallens.com/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/privacy/","section":"","summary":"\u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Privacy Policy","type":"page"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Embed your slides or video here using shortcodes.

To answer this question, I take as my starting point the assumption that concepts are unobservable theoretical entities posited to serve of both explanatory and coherence purposes. Based on this, I make a distinction between the desiderata of an ideal theory of concepts put forward by Fodor (1998) and Prinz (2002) in explanatory desiderata and theoretical desiderata. As theoretical desiderata are compromises imposed by the Representational Theory of Mind, their acceptance is not a requirement. I will then identify the explananda that concepts are posited to explain by analizing only the explanatory desiderata. Once they have been identified, I will put forward both alternative descriptions of the phenomena and plausible explanations of them in those terms. Thus, I expect to overturn the foundation of what has been considered as the main argument for the existence of concepts: their exclusivity as explanations of their explananda. I conclude with some remarks on the theoretical and metatheoretical consequences of the proposed arguments.","tags":null,"title":"Palabra y concepto: acercamiento a un eliminativismo conceptual en ciencia cognitiva [Word and concept: an approach to concept eliminativism in cognitive science]","type":"publication"}]
